## User Stories: 🗺️

1-) As a user, I want to navigate easily through the horoscope web page, so I can access different sections without confusion.

2-) As a user, I want the navbar links on the homepage to redirect me to the corresponding sections, so I can find information about specific zodiac signs quickly.

3-) As a user, I want to see the endpoints change in the address bar when I click on navbar links, so I can understand the navigation path and bookmark specific sections if needed.

4-) As a user, I want to hover over Tarot cards and see information about the associated zodiac signs, so I can learn more about them without navigating away from the current page.

5-) As a user, I want the navbar to remain fixed at the top when I scroll down the page, so I can access navigation options conveniently without having to scroll back to the top.
